## Thoughts ahead

Great to use.
Once you use it, you can't get away from it.

## Postscript

GitHub Copilot is now in full release.
This article was written during the beta version, so corrections have been made throughout.

## How to use

Sign up for GitHub Copilot at Sign up on the following page (free)

https://copilot.github.com/

~~You will have to wait for a long time after registering.~~
~~In my case, I waited 3~4 months.~~

Free for the first 60 days, paid thereafter.
($10/month, $100/year.)

You may think it's expensive, but when you read this article, you may be thinking.
"Are you sure you just want to pay $10?"
You may think.
Also, if you are a student or a contributor to OSS, you can use the service for free.

## Good and great points

### Summarizes the code for you

#### I want to explain the code

I want GitHub Copilot to explain what this code is doing!

#### I need you to explain the processing flow of the code

Next, I'll ask GitHub Copilot to explain the code, focusing on the flow of the code process!

### It converts the code to another language

I suddenly feel like porting the code I just wrote to Ruby and Python, so I'll have it translated.

#### Python

#### Ruby

It is well translated.
It is great that GitHub Copilot understands the default values.

### It works surprisingly well without any comments

Example

The following code is generated by itself with just `def average` or `func average`.

```python
def average(data):
    return sum(data) / len(data)
```

```go
func average(data []float64) float64 {
    return sum(data) / float64(len(data))
}
```

### Predict even from variable names

The example below only has `input_age` input.

```python
input_age = input("Enter your age: ")
```

### Easy to read

The output is in light text, so it is easy to read.

### Multiple answers

If there is more than one answer, as shown in the image below, you can select one!

### Really understand what the code means

In the code below, all I typed in was `def average` and `print("The average is`.
The rest is all automatic.

```python
def average(data):
    return sum(data) / len(data)

print("The average is", average([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))
```

### If you type in a sequence of numbers, it will guess the rest of the sequence

python only `def prime_number`
go and typescript only `func` and `const` respectively

```python
def prime_number(n):
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```

```go
func prime_number(n int) bool {
    for i := 2; i < n; i++ {
        if n % i == 0 {
            return false
        }
    }
    return true
}
```

```typescript
const prime_number = (n: number) => {
    for (let i = 2; i < n; i++) {
        if (n % i === 0) {
            return false
        }
    }
    return true
}
```

#### Other examples

I have only written the name of the language except for the first sentence.

## Unsettling points

- Licensing issues
- Is the code correct?
- Conflicts with code completion.
- etc...

~~It's not an official release yet, so it's not surprising that there are some complaints.~~

## Summary

Use at your own risk, but you get a partner like Esper.
Development speed will increase (maybe).
